    description: `So Victoria and I have been best friends since elementary school. We
      met when her father became the pastor of our church. It has been a
      long road ever since. We fight like sisters but we also love like
      twins. My favourite memory of us has to be when we almost burnt down
      our church. It was during a fasting service (so we shouldn‚Äôt have
      even been eating in the first place üòÇ) but we were so hungry and we
      knew there were patties in the kitchen and there was no way we could
      resist food knowing it was in reach. Now I don‚Äôt know how we managed
      to burn simple patties but it takes each of our half brains to make
      a full one so that should tell you something. I just remember we
      were terrified the smoke alarm would go off and everyone would be
      able to smell our sin ü§£`,

    description: `Victoria and I first met at the ‚ÄúVic One: Ryerson
    Stream‚Äù orientation at the University of Toronto - which
    was made up of other students interested in becoming
    teachers. I was having a conversation with Victoria‚Äôs
    mom and that‚Äôs when we realized we lived in Ajax. I
    ended up exchanging phone numbers with Victoria but
    didn‚Äôt talk to her until our first day of University. On
    our first day of Vic One, Victoria and I ran into each
    other on the Go Train. We sat together and instantly
    became friends. We spent the next 5 years talking about
    our lives in detail, catching Go Trains, taking subway
    rides to classes that were not that far, failing exams,
    procrastinating on assignments and staying up VERY late
    to finish those assignments. We became best friends and
    ‚Äútwinions‚Äù (twin minions) for life! Our friendship is so
    special to me because we shared important moments in our
    lives - from graduating to decorating her first
    classroom. Victoria is one of my best friends and I
    couldn‚Äôt feel more blessed to be a part of her and
    Kelub‚Äôs special day. üòä`,

    George‚Äôs arrived at Bathurst (if you know, you know) and
    we sat together on them hard wooden church benches (you
    in the middle, always), we‚Äôve been inseparable.
    TWENTY-TWO YEARS (üò±)-and a whole lotta sleepovers,
    laughter, nonsensical videos (which shall remain in the
    vault üëÄ) and heart-to-hearts- later, you‚Äôre still my
    soul seester and best friend‚Äîa literal gift to all who
    know you. I can‚Äôt wait to see you step into this new
    role as wife, with the beautiful grace and light you
    bring with you always. To you (and my new
    brother-in-law, Kelub üòâ), all my love, God‚Äôs greatest
    blessings and all the happiness in the world. ‚ù§Ô∏è`,

    description: `Ahhh, reminiscing on the good old days that are still
    growing!! Victoria, the Zoey to my Chloe! My fellow
    wedding-lover! As kids we were adventure buddies, hence
    our little nicknames. We first met at church but our
    friendship grew after becoming neighbours! As children
    we went to summer camps, made friendship bracelets, had
    a club called KRMV, sleepovers and even hid in closets
    pretending we were in a car LOL (our imaginations are
    wild, which I‚Äôve always loved about us!) In our youth
    years, we went to high school together, performed in
    musicals, sang in church choir and let‚Äôs say...girls
    just wanna have fun!! As adults, we‚Äôve continued to grow
    as women in our personal careers, while enjoying walks,
    parties, devotions and retreats. Now I could on and on
    into full detail of our friendship and the adventures
    we‚Äôve been through but it‚Äôd turn into a novel! Overall,
    throughout the years, we have experienced many new
    things together and have learned from each, through the
    good and bad, side by side. Two extraverts with a
    passion for children. Two crazy girls who love to be the
    life of the party. But above all, two sisters in Christ
    who always got each other&apos;s back. Today, we are
    soul sisters for life! Now here we are, at the start of
    another new chapter! Cheers to the moment we‚Äôve spoken
    about our ENTIRE lives!!`,

    description: `We met when I was in 6th grade and you were in 7th. At
    that time at Dr. Roberta Bondar we had no idea how
    special we would become to each other. Fast forward to
    the end of High School and we meet again in the House of
    God and I am very grateful for that. Juliet you are a
    ray of sunshine who gets my jokes. We can be drunk on
    nothing but laughter. I love your energy, love for God
    and prayers. My prayer is that Kelub will continue to
    give you a reason to laugh and fill your days with love.

    description: `Hey I&apos;m Yakira but my friends call me Kira. I have
    known Victoria for (I can&apos;t even count the years)
    all I know is one sunny day she appeared in my life and
    the rest is history. Our relationship is a wild,
    adventurous and spontaneous type of friendship. She is
    truly a one of a kind type of friend! Being around her I
    can honestly say is never a dull moment! Her laugh is
    contagious and her jokes are hilarious. She is a dime
    +99 and having her in my life has been such a blessing.
    I could go on but I&apos;ll leave you with a quote.
    <br />
    <br />
    &quot;The most beautiful discovery true friends make is
    that they can grow separately without growing
    apart.&quot;

    description: `I first met Victoria at church in Ottawa when she came
    to visit for the first time and that day I had no clue
    what was coming in store for the rest of my life. Since
    that day, there‚Äôs been one experience after another but
    nothing that I would take back. I‚Äôve always wanted to
    have a sister and now I finally have one. She has
    already helped me through different situations that only
    a sister could help another with. I finally have someone
    that I can talk about makeup with or, talk about clothes
    with or, give me advice someone who has wayyy more years
    on me could give. She‚Äôs an incredible hard worker and
    still she has the time to be an even better family
    member. I wish her prosperity and success in whatever
    she plans to do in the future, by the grace of God. To
    Victoria, my newly found sister, my new well of advice,
    welcome to the family and congratulations on this new
    journey you will embark on. ‚ù§Ô∏è`,
